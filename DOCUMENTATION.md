## 1. Problem Statement

The communication infrastructure in higher education institutions is fundamentally broken. Student grievances are trapped in fragmented WhatsApp groups, ignored institutional emails, and performative suggestion boxes — never reaching decision-makers with the urgency or data they require. There is no unified system to aggregate, quantify, or escalate student feedback, and institutions face **zero consequence for ignoring complaints entirely**. Worse, when administrators do respond, they can mark issues "resolved" without evidence or accountability — and students have no mechanism to challenge fake fixes. This systemic failure creates a cycle of complaint fatigue, institutional inertia, and eroding trust that no existing tool addresses because **the problem is not communication — it is the complete absence of enforced accountability**.

---

## 2. Proposed Idea

**Gravit** is a centralized, real-time web platform that converts isolated student grievances into structured, publicly tracked, and automatically escalated institutional data. It is built around three core mechanisms that no existing platform offers:

1. **Velocity-Weighted Urgency Scoring** — An exponential time-decay algorithm that measures *how fast* upvotes are growing, not just how many exist. This detects emerging crises in real time (50 upvotes in 2 hours triggers faster than 200 over a month).

2. **Dead Man's Switch (DMS)** — An automatic hierarchical escalation system. If an escalated issue receives no admin response within a configured time window, it auto-escalates to the next level in the institutional hierarchy (HoD → Dean → VC → Public Transparency Report). Silence becomes progressively more expensive.

3. **Resolution Verification Loop** — When an admin marks an issue "Resolved," students receive a 48-hour verification poll. If >50% reject the claimed fix, the issue automatically re-escalates at the next hierarchy level with a "Resolution Rejected" badge. Administrators cannot performatively close tickets.

These three mechanisms work together to create a system where **complaints cannot be lost, silence is punished, and fixes must be real**.

## 3. Solution Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

Gravit follows a **decoupled, event-driven architecture** with five distinct subsystems:

### 3.2 Tech Stack — What & Why

#### Frontend: React.js + Socket.io-client + Tailwind CSS

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **Component-based UI** | Each core feature (post feed, threaded comments, urgency meter, DMS countdown timer, verification poll) is an isolated React component, enabling parallel development across team members. |
| **Real-time rendering** | Socket.io-client subscribes to post-specific rooms. When any user upvotes, the urgency score recalculates server-side and pushes a `urgency:update` event — the React urgency meter updates instantly without page reload. |
| **Optimistic UI** | Upvotes and poll votes render immediately on the client (optimistic state), then reconcile with server confirmation within milliseconds. This makes the platform feel instant. |
| **Live DMS Timer** | A countdown component receives the `response_deadline` from the API and ticks down in real time. When it hits zero, a `dms:triggered` Socket event updates the badge to "⏰ Escalated to Dean." |
| **Verification Poll UI** | When an admin claims resolution, all subscribed clients receive `verification:start` and render an inline Yes/No poll with a live-updating tally bar. |

#### Backend: Node.js + Express.js

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **REST API** | All CRUD operations — posts, comments, upvotes, admin responses, verification votes — exposed via Express routes with JWT-authenticated middleware. |
| **Socket.io Server** | Runs alongside Express on the same Node process. Manages 4 namespaces: `/posts` (upvote + urgency sync), `/status` (state transitions + DMS), `/presence` (active user count), `/verify` (resolution poll events). Uses room-based broadcasting (`post:{id}`, `channel:{name}`, `institution:{id}`) so events reach only relevant clients. |
| **State Machine Engine** | Enforces the 6-state post lifecycle (`open → trending → escalated → pending_verification → resolved / resolution_rejected`). All transitions are validated server-side — the client cannot force a state change. Transitions are irreversible forward. |
| **Velocity Scoring Engine** | On every upvote, the API recalculates the post's urgency score using the exponential time-decay formula. If the score crosses T₁ (trending) or T₂ (escalation), the state machine transitions automatically and fires the n8n webhook. |
| **RBAC Middleware** | Three roles enforced at the route level: Student (post, vote, verify), Moderator (merge, flag), Admin (respond, view dashboard). Admins **cannot** access user identities or delete posts. |
| **Pseudonymous Identity** | On registration, a persistent pseudonym (`Anon-7F3A`) is generated via one-way hash of the user's internal UUID + institution-scoped salt. The real-identity ↔ pseudonym mapping is stored in an encrypted column, inaccessible to application-level queries. |

#### Primary Database: PostgreSQL

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **Transactional integrity** | ACID compliance is critical for: upvote deduplication (composite PK on `user_id, target_id`), state transitions (only valid forward transitions), and verification vote counting (exactly one vote per user per poll). |
| **Threaded comments** | Materialized Path pattern — each comment stores its full ancestry as a path string (e.g., `root/a1b2/c3d4`). Fetching an entire thread is a single query: `SELECT * FROM comments WHERE post_id = $1 ORDER BY path`. Insertion is O(1). |
| **Escalation hierarchy** | The `escalation_hierarchy` table maps each channel × level to a specific contact email and response window. The DMS cron job joins against this table to determine who to notify next and how long they have. |
| **Velocity scoring support** | Every upvote has a `created_at` timestamp. The urgency score query reads all vote timestamps and applies the decay function. PostgreSQL's `TIMESTAMPTZ` type handles timezone-safe calculations natively. |

**Core tables:** `institutions`, `users`, `posts` (with `urgency_score`, `current_escalation_level`, `escalated_at`, `last_admin_response_at`), `comments`, `upvotes`, `escalations`, `escalation_hierarchy`, `resolution_verifications`, `verification_votes`.

#### Analytics Store: MongoDB

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **Denormalized dashboard data** | The admin dashboard needs pre-aggregated data (urgency heatmaps, resolution time distributions, DMS trigger frequency). Writing these aggregations to MongoDB's schema-flexible documents avoids expensive real-time joins on PostgreSQL. |
| **Time-series urgency data** | Urgency scores are logged periodically to MongoDB, enabling "urgency score over time" charts that show how fast an issue gained traction — useful for the admin dashboard's trending visualization. |
| **Non-blocking writes** | Analytics writes don't interfere with the primary transactional workload on PostgreSQL. The API fires and forgets to MongoDB after each state change. |

#### Workflow Automation: n8n (self-hosted)

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **Decoupled escalation logic** | PDF generation, email templating, and SMTP dispatch are NOT in the core API. They live entirely in n8n workflows, making the escalation pipeline independently iterable without touching backend code. |
| **Three-branch escalation** | A single webhook endpoint receives all escalation triggers. An n8n **Switch node** branches by `trigger_type`: (1) `threshold` — standard urgency-triggered report, (2) `dead_mans_switch` — report with non-response timeline and "Ignored at X levels" header, (3) `resolution_rejected` — report with admin's claimed fix and student rejection vote tally. |
| **PDF generation** | n8n's HTML-to-PDF node (or a Function node with `pdfkit`) compiles the thread data into a branded, formal PDF: issue title, urgency score, top comments, engagement metrics, escalation history, and a direct link to the post. |
| **Email dispatch** | n8n's SMTP node (or SendGrid/Mailgun node) sends the PDF-attached email to the recipient determined by `escalation_level` × `escalation_hierarchy` table. Callback to the API logs the dispatch in the `escalations` table. |
| **Why n8n over custom code** | Building 3 PDF templates + email dispatch + retry logic from scratch = 3-4 days. Doing it in n8n's visual builder = **3-4 hours**. This is the critical hackathon force multiplier. |

#### Scheduling: node-cron

| Role in Architecture | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dead Man's Switch monitor** | Runs **every hour**. Queries all posts in `escalated` or `resolution_rejected` status where `last_admin_response_at IS NULL` and the response window has elapsed. For each match, fires the n8n webhook at the next hierarchy level. |
| **Verification poll enforcer** | Runs **every 15 minutes**. Queries `resolution_verifications` where `outcome = 'pending'` and `deadline < NOW()`. Tallies votes and: if >50% reject → transitions post to `resolution_rejected` and triggers re-escalation; if >50% confirm → transitions to `resolved`. |
| **Why node-cron** | Lightweight, zero-dependency, runs in the same Node.js process. No need for external schedulers (Celery, Bull) for a hackathon prototype. |

## 4. How the USPs Work in the Architecture

### 4.1 Velocity-Weighted Urgency Scoring

**The formula:**

$$S(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{-\lambda \cdot (t_{now} - t_i)}$$

- $\lambda$ = 0.05/hour (configurable). Recent upvotes contribute ~1.0 weight, 24h-old votes ~0.3, week-old votes ~0.0.
- Calculated in the **Node.js API** on every upvote event by querying `created_at` timestamps from the `upvotes` table in **PostgreSQL**.
- The updated score is written to `posts.urgency_score` and broadcast to all subscribed clients via **Socket.io** (`urgency:update` event).
- The **React** frontend renders this as a live color-coded urgency meter (green → yellow → orange → red).
- When the score crosses T₂, the **state machine** transitions the post to `escalated` and fires the **n8n** webhook.

| Scenario | Raw Count | Urgency Score | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50 upvotes in 2 hours | 50 | ~45.2 | Escalated |
| 200 upvotes over 30 days | 200 | ~12.8 | Trending only |
| 100 upvotes, 80 in last 6h | 100 | ~68.4 | Escalated |

### 4.2 Dead Man's Switch (DMS)

**Flow through the stack:**

1. Post reaches `escalated` status → `posts.escalated_at` is set (**PostgreSQL**).
2. **node-cron** (hourly) joins `posts` with `escalation_hierarchy` to find posts where the response window has elapsed with no admin response.
3. For each match, the cron job increments `posts.current_escalation_level`, fires the **n8n** webhook with `trigger_type: 'dead_mans_switch'`.
4. **n8n** Switch node routes to the DMS branch → generates a PDF with non-response timeline + "Ignored at X levels" header → emails the next-level recipient.
5. **Socket.io** broadcasts `dms:triggered` to all clients → **React** updates the post badge: "⏰ Escalated to Dean — HoD did not respond in 72 hours."

```
Level 1: HoD ──── 72h silence ────► Level 2: Dean
Level 2: Dean ─── 120h silence ───► Level 3: VC
Level 3: VC ───── 168h silence ───► Level 4: Public Transparency Report
```

### 4.3 Resolution Verification Loop

**Flow through the stack:**

1. Admin clicks "Mark Resolved" and provides a resolution description → **Express API** creates a `resolution_verifications` record with a 48h deadline (**PostgreSQL**). Post status → `pending_verification`.
2. **Socket.io** emits `verification:start` to all clients in the post's room → **React** renders an inline poll: "Was this actually resolved? ✅ Yes / ❌ No"
3. Students cast votes → stored in `verification_votes` (one per user per poll, **PostgreSQL**). Each vote broadcasts a `verification:vote` event → **React** updates the live tally bar.
4. **node-cron** (every 15 min) checks expired polls:
   - **>50% confirm** → `resolved`. Department credited on leaderboard.
   - **>50% reject** → `resolution_rejected`. Post auto re-escalates at next hierarchy level. **n8n** fires a report: *"Resolution rejected by X% of N verified students."*

## 5. State Machine — Post Lifecycle

| State | Trigger | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Open**  | Post created | Collecting upvotes. Urgency score computing in real time. |
| **Trending**  | Urgency score ≥ T₁ | Highlighted in feeds. Urgency meter turns yellow/orange. |
| **Escalated**  | Urgency score ≥ T₂ | n8n generates PDF → emails HoD. **DMS timer starts.** |
| **Pending Verification**  | Admin responds | 48h student poll. Post is **not** closed yet. |
| **Resolved**  | >50% students confirm | Verified resolution. Leaderboard credit. Archived. |
| **Resolution Rejected**  | >50% students reject | Auto re-escalates at next hierarchy level with rejection proof. |

```
[Open]──(S≥T₁)──►[Trending]──(S≥T₂)──►[Escalated]──(admin)──►[Pending Verification]
                                            │                           │
                                     (DMS: no response)         (>50% reject)
                                            ▼                           ▼
                                    [Auto-escalate             [Resolution Rejected
                                     HoD→Dean→VC→Public]       → re-escalate next level]
```

**Rules:** Forward-only transitions. Admin "resolution" is not final — students verify. DMS and rejection independently climb the hierarchy.

---

## 6. Sub-Channels & Escalation Mapping

| Channel | Scope | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **c/Academia** | Curriculum, faculty, grading | HoD | Dean | VC | Public |
| **c/Bureaucracy** | Fees, documents, registration | Registrar | Admin Head | VC | Public |
| **c/Infrastructure** | Labs, hostels, safety | Estate Officer | Dean | VC | Public |
| **c/Placement** | Placement cell, companies | TPO | Dean | VC | Public |

Each channel maintains **independent urgency thresholds** and a **full DMS hierarchy chain** configured in the `escalation_hierarchy` table.

---

## 7. Auth & Identity System

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Verification** | .edu email domain whitelisting + OAuth 2.0 / JWT token verification. Only verified institutional members can access the platform. |
| **Pseudonymity** | Persistent pseudonym (`Anon-7F3A`) generated via one-way hash (user UUID + institution salt). Real identity encrypted, inaccessible to admins/students. |
| **Deanonymization** | Multi-party authorization only (legal subpoena / verified abuse report). Never unilateral. |
| **RBAC** | Student: post, upvote, comment, verify. Moderator: flag, merge, tag. Admin: respond, view analytics. Admins **cannot** see identities or delete posts. |

---

## 8. Feasibility & Impact

### Implementation Effort (Hackathon Scope)

| Feature | Effort | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Core platform (posts, threading, upvotes, real-time) | ~8 hours | React + Express + PostgreSQL + Socket.io |
| Velocity scoring algorithm | ~1 hour | 1 function + 1 column + React urgency meter |
| Dead Man's Switch | ~2 hours | node-cron job + `escalation_hierarchy` table + n8n branch |
| Resolution Verification | ~3 hours | 2 tables + Socket namespace + React poll component |
| n8n escalation pipeline (3 PDF types) | ~3 hours | Visual workflow builder, Switch node, SMTP node |
| Admin dashboard (basic) | ~3 hours | MongoDB aggregations + React charts |
| **Total** | **~20 hours** | Feasible for a 24-36 hour hackathon with 3-4 members |

### Department Leaderboard (Anti-Gaming)

Leaderboard is powered by **verified data** — resolutions must pass student verification to count:

- **Average verified resolution time** — only student-confirmed resolutions count.
- **First-response time** — DMS triggers logged as "No Response" penalty.
- **Verification success rate** — high rejection rate = flagged as performative.
- **DMS trigger count** — public "⏰ Non-Responses" metric.

Departments **cannot game the leaderboard** by closing tickets without real fixes.

### Stakeholder Impact

| Stakeholder | Before Gravit | After Gravit |
|---|---|---|
| **Students** | Complaints vanish. Fake fixes unchallenged. | Public, velocity-prioritized, auto-escalated. Students verify fixes. |
| **HoDs** | No urgency to respond. | Visible DMS countdown. Respond or get escalated to Dean. |
| **Dean/VC** | Hears about issues too late via informal channels. | Receives formal reports only when lower levels failed — with evidence. |
| **Institution** | Accreditation gaps. Social media reputation risk. | Auditable, verified resolution data. Internal resolution before public exposure. |

## 9. Why Gravit Wins

1. **Verified voices, protected identities.** .edu verification ensures authenticity; pseudonymous posting ensures safety.
2. **Velocity-scored, not just counted.** Detects crises by momentum, not volume. 50 upvotes in 2 hours > 200 over a month.
3. **Silence is punished.** Dead Man's Switch auto-escalates up the hierarchy. Ignoring makes it worse, not quieter.
4. **Students verify the fix.** Fake resolutions re-escalate with proof. "Resolved" on Gravit means students confirmed it.
5. **Performance is public and ungameable.** Leaderboards track verified metrics, DMS triggers, and rejection rates.
